How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on realizing a colorful and easy-to-navigate user interface, using color contrast to diffentiate containers and sections.

Optimizations

To improve this project, I want to update the choice of colors and work on a responsive design to make it accessible from all devices.

Lessons Learned:

Images of different sizes can be tricky when displayed in the same amount of space. The layout has to be built with this focus in mind, moreover when the web app is built around these images.
