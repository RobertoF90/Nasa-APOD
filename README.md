How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on realizing user interface which could adapt to images of different sizes.

Optimizations

To improve this project, I want to add animations and insert the option of bookmarking favourite images.

Lessons Learned:

Images of different sizes can be tricky when displayed in the same amount of space. The layout has to be built with this focus in mind, moreover when the web app is built around these images.
